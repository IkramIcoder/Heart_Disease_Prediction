# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Orange Data Mining

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of **heart disease** using **Orange Data Mining**, a visual programming tool for data analysis and machine learning. The dataset includes various clinical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable model that can classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their medical attributes.
