# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction and COVID-19 Trends using Orange Data Mining

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases the application of **visual data mining** using **Orange 3.36** for health analytics, specifically focusing on:

- **Heart Disease Prediction**
- **COVID-19 Trend Analysis**

The aim is to demonstrate how intuitive visual tools can help extract predictive insights from complex healthcare datasets. Orange enables a no-code environment for data preprocessing, classification, and visualization, making it accessible yet powerful for both beginners and analysts.

## 🔍 Modules Covered

### 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

- **Tool:** Orange 3.36
- **Dataset:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
  🔗 [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature visualization
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest (via Orange’s classification widget)
- **Workflow:**
  - Load dataset
  - Preprocess (handle missing values, normalize features)
  - Visualize key attributes (e.g., chest pain, max heart rate)
  - Apply classification model
  - Evaluate using **Test & Score**, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve

### 🦠 COVID-19 Trend Analysis

- **Tool:** Orange 3.36
- **Dataset:** Global COVID-19 data from WHO  
  🔗 [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/)
- **Techniques:** Time-series analysis, line/bar plots, trend comparison
- **Workflow:**
  - Load global case data
  - Aggregate by country/region and date
  - Visualize trends over time
  - Identify and compare infection waves and recovery trends

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Orange Data Mining** (v3.36)
- **UCI ML Repository**
- **WHO Global COVID-19 Dataset**
- Optional scripting in **Python** using Orange's embedded scripting widget

---

## 📊 Sample Results

- **Heart Disease Module:**  
  - Random Forest achieved ~85% accuracy  
  - High interpretability via feature visualization  
  - ROC and Confusion Matrix clearly show model performance

- **COVID-19 Module:**  
  - Visualization of infection trends across regions  
  - Pattern recognition of multiple infection waves  
  - Comparison of daily case counts and recovery rates

---

## 📈 Applications

- ✅ Early diagnosis and risk assessment for cardiovascular disease
- 📈 Monitoring COVID-19 infection patterns at scale
- 🧠 Educational resource for teaching data mining and epidemiology
- 📊 Support tool for public health planning and analytics
- 🧪 Demonstrates visual, no-code machine learning workflows

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Datasets used are **static** (non-real-time)
- Orange lacks **advanced model tuning** capabilities
- Results depend on **data quality and completeness**
- COVID-19 module is **descriptive**, not predictive
- Limited **generalizability** across different populations
